# p0_final_project_franklinm
This is the Git Repository that I will use for my P0: Final Project. For this project I will be extending A5: Game of Nim and T1: Choose Your Own Adventure
This game is called The Abandoned Hospital
In this game your goal is to beat the BOSS and leave the hospital alive
Here are the instruction on how to play the game:
  a. you start outside of the hospital with full health
  b. a villain will be generated to battle you to the death
  c. there will battle the BOSS within SIX turns:
      you can either:
          1. Rest (there is a chance that the BOSS will land a attack on you and you lose health, there's also a chance the BOSS can miss)
          2. Fight (for this you will be rolled a dice, this will decide if your attack will damage the BOSS or not)
  d. the game will continue until either YOU or the BOSS have no more health
  e. if you manage to kill the BOSS, you win
  f. if you manage to lose all of your health within the six turns, you lose
  g. if you lose all your health before you make it to the emd you lose
