This is the Git Repository that I will use for my P0: Final Project. For this project I will be extending A5: Game of Nim and T1: Choose Your Own Adventure
This game is called Haunted House (this is subject to change)
In this game your goal is to make it to the final level with more than 30 points (you start off with 30)
Here are the instruction on how to play the game:
  a. you start outside the house with each floor of the house being a new level to get to
  b. on each floor there will be a villain that you will encounter
  c. there will be three options to choose from when you came to an enemy:
      you can either:
          1. Run-Away (you lose 2 points)
          2. You fight (you have the possiblity to either lose 3 points or gain 3 points)
          3. You hide (you have the possibilty to either lose 1 point or gain 1 point)
  d. you go through all five levels with these guidelines
  e. if you make it to the final level and have more than 30 points you win
  f. if you make it to the final level and don't have more than 30 points, you lose
  g. (this could be a possibilty) if you lose all your points before you make it to the final level you lose
